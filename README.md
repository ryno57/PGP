# Project GP *(working title)*

**Welcome!**  
This is my first game project, currently in early development. I'm learning as I go, so big features may take time, but I'm fully committed to building something ambitious and unique.

## What is Project GP?

Project GP is a **motorcycle motorsport management game**.  
You’ll build your own racing team, manage riders and staff, navigate global events, and grow your business empire, all while shaping the world around you.

### Planned Features for Final Release:
-  Team building & management
-  Dynamic world events affecting economy, riders, and more
-  Deep business systems: contracts, loans, salaries, auctions
-  World-building elements to shape your environment

> These features may evolve over time, for better or worse as development progresses.

## Current Development Status

As of **August 30, 2025**, I’m actively working on **Build 3.1**.  
This version focuses on polishing the core experience and laying visual foundations.

### Build 3.1 Goals:
-  Restyling all UI elements and menus
-  Visual overhaul of the Garage Map *(currently just a white floor and a blue cube)*

## 📅 2025 Roadmap

Here’s what I plan to tackle next:

-  Add basic settings to the main menu:
  - Resolution
  - Window mode (fullscreen/borderless)
  - VSync toggle
  - FPS cap
-  Begin modeling the garage:
  - Add walls, basic textures, a table, and a proper PC setup
-  Start building the in-game computer interface:
  - A “cheap Windows-style” desktop with apps and interactions

##  Stay tuned

I’ll be updating this repo regularly as I learn and build.
