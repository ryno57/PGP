# Project GP *(working title)*

**Welcome!**  
This is my first game project, currently in early development. I'm learning as I go, so big features may take time, but I'm fully committed to building something ambitious and unique.

## What is Project GP?

Project GP is a **motorcycle motorsport management game**.  
You’ll build your own racing team, manage riders and staff, navigate global events, and grow your business empire, all while shaping the world around you.

### Planned Features for Final Release:
-  Team building & management
-  Dynamic world events affecting economy, riders, and more
-  Deep business systems: contracts, loans, salaries, auctions
-  World-building elements to shape your environment

> These features may evolve over time, for better or worse as development progresses.

## Current Development Status

As of **August 30, 2025**, I’m actively working on **Build 3.2**.  
This version focuses on polishing the core experience and laying visual foundations.

### Build 3.x Goals:
-  Restyling all UI elements and menus (again)
-  Visual overhaul of the Garage Map *(currently just a white floor and a blue cube)*
-  Tweaking some graphics

##  Stay tuned

I’ll be updating this repo regularly as I learn and build.  
Thanks for checking out my project and feel free to follow along or drop feedback!
